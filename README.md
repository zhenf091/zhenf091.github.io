Code 2 is a continuation of the principles and techniques taught in Code 1. Students will expand their conceptual and technical skills in the pursuit of mastering code and procedurality as a tool for creative, critical, and aesthetic exploration and expression. The class content will focus on building more complex systems and exploring specific creative applications of code. Topics will include algorithms, object-oriented programming, and the historical and cultural context of software in art and design. Students will work with Processing and P5.js to produce interactive and experiential work, culminating in a final project that creatively demonstrates their grasp of code.
